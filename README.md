#ü§ñ AI Assistance Features

Live Transcription
Real-time conversion of speech into notes as users speak or during recordings.
Transcribed text appears in the note-taking area in sync with the audio timeline.
Useful for lectures, meetings, interviews, or brainstorming sessions.
AI Summarization & Contextual Notes
GPT-4 powered summarization of long transcriptions or typed content.
Generates bullet points, graphs/tables, and simplified explanations.
Context-aware note suggestions based on current topic and historical notes.
Smart Search
Instead of matching exact keywords, Smart Search understands the meaning of your question and surfaces results based on that.
Queries like ‚ÄúShow me all notes where the professor explained supply and demand.‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere are my calculus practice problems with integrals?‚Äù would return note snippets or a filtered list of notes
Document Q&A (Fill-in-the-Blank AI Answers)
AI scans user-uploaded documents (e.g. worksheets, question sets).
Identifies conceptual and computational questions.
Uses GPT to fill in blanks, solve math problems, and explain answers inline.
Ai Assistance (Optional)
Detects key terms, dates, equations, or concepts.
Highlights them in the document and adds tooltips or definitions.
Users can ask natural questions like ‚ÄúSummarize what i studied on July 4th‚Äù etc.
Helps in exam preparation and active learning.
Collaborative Note-Taking (Multi-User Live Sessions)
Multiple users can join a shared note session in real time.
Users can draw, type, and comment together.
Live cursors and user labels for visibility.
Ideal for classrooms, group studies, or team meetings.
